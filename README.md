# FAKE STORE

### Hello World, once again! Today I come with this project to challenge myself even more, fetching an API I found here on github. This time, I created a prototype of a store based on some of my knowledge I've been building during these weeks and I'm learning a lot. I intend to re-build this project in the future in a more complex version, whit more features and also with the backend part, then I can show you a complete version of an online store.

### For this project I've used:

-   Vanilla JS
-   Sass
-   Vite

### Hope you enjoy it! To access, click here -> [Fake Store]()
